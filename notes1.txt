GUIDO VAN ROSSUM developed python in 1991.
PEP-Python enhancement proposal.

Whenever we add file from local machine to git repository is called push operation.
And if download any file that is known as pull operation.
Python is an extensible language.

3)logical thinking.
4)Mathematical thinking.

==> DS
1) Access
2) Store

==> List- It is heterogeneous data structure.It is mutable.The list can be nested(list inside a list).It should be finite,ordered,mutable, sequence of elements.  a=[2,4,6,8,1,3,5,7]
==> Dictionary - (key,value).Here every keyword having a unique meaning.It is also mutable map from hashable values to arbitrary objects.  e1=dict(one=1,two=2,three=3)

==> Tuple= It is a immutable sequence.It is used to store heterogeneous data.    t1=("Name","Vishal").  
==> Membership fxn - Use to search the element/value.

==> In control flow If statement we have - 
                                       a) 4 space to indent b) colon c) no curly braces
==> Python is not having any switch statement.
==> When no. of condition is not known is called ODD loop.
==> 1) What is the operator presidence in python?

==> In python everything is a object.Objects are always typed(defined).And it have a identity.And variables are untyped.
==> The 'is' operator is used to check identity not equality.

==> We use .get keyword to avoid the KeyError.
==> We can delete values with del and pop fxns.
==> ('Name','Vishal') in d1.items() it is a membership fxn used for comparing the value(that value is in the list or not).

==> Swapping 
>>> x=5
	
>>> y=6
	
>>> x=x^y
	
>>> y=x^y
	
>>> x=x^y
	
>>> print(x,y)
	
6 5
>>> x,y=y,x
	
>>> x
	
5
>>> y
	
6

==> PIP- It is a package manager for python.
==> Sets- Collection of well defined things.
